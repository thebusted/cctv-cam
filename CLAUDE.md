# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository is for a CCTV camera project. The codebase is currently in its initial state.

## Project Status

The repository has been initialized but contains no implementation files yet. Future development should establish:

- The programming language and framework to be used
- Core architecture for camera interaction (stream handling, recording, storage)
- Configuration management approach
- Testing strategy
- Deployment method

## Development Workflow

Once the project structure is established, this section should include:

- Build commands
- Testing commands
- How to run the application locally
- Configuration requirements

## Architecture Notes

This section will be populated as the architecture is defined. Key areas to document:

- Camera connection and stream management
- Video processing pipeline
- Storage architecture
- Any web interface or API design
- Security considerations for camera access
