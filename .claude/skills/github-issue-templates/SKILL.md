# GitHub Issue Templates

Apply standardized GitHub issue templates to create clear, actionable issues for different purposes.

## Available Templates

Four template types are available in the `assets/` directory:

- **feature_request.md** - For new features or enhancements
- **bug_report.md** - For reporting bugs or unexpected behavior  
- **research.md** - For investigation and analysis tasks
- **documentation.md** - For documentation updates or new docs

## Usage

1. **Identify the issue type** from the user's request
2. **Read the appropriate template** from `assets/`
3. **Fill in the template** with details from the user's request
4. **Present the formatted issue** ready to paste into GitHub

## Template Selection Guide

**Use feature_request.md when:**
- User describes a desired capability or improvement
- Request includes "feature", "enhancement", "add", "support for"
- User suggests new functionality

**Use bug_report.md when:**
- User reports unexpected behavior or errors
- Request includes "bug", "error", "broken", "doesn't work", "crash"
- Something is not working as intended

**Use research.md when:**
- User needs to investigate options or approaches
- Request includes "research", "investigate", "analyze", "explore"
- Decision-making requires more information

**Use documentation.md when:**
- User identifies missing or outdated documentation
- Request includes "document", "docs", "README", "guide", "explain"
- Need to create or update written materials

## Customization

Templates are starting points. Adapt sections based on:
- Project complexity (remove sections for simple projects)
- Team workflow (add custom fields as needed)
- Issue specificity (condense when details are limited)

Keep the core structure but adjust verbosity to match the context.
